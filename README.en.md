DESCRIPTION
-----------

Some delivery services have long and heavy-to-copy estimation calculators ontheir web-sites.
You can place links to these pages on your checkout page and text about usual estimated price range
instead the fixed price of this method. Customer can look it, select better service and write
about his/her choice in the comment field.

The text can be changed in language files:

  * `courier_ua/admin/language/english/shipping/courier_ua.php`
  * `courier_ua/catalog/language/english/shipping/courier_ua.php`

To change price (0.00 by default) to something like minimum amount you can change digits in line #24
('cost' => 0.00) inside the file

  * `catalog/model/shipping/courier_russia.php` (`courier_ua.php`)


Archive contains 10 modules with different codes (for Russia and Ukraine by default), they can be modified
in language files and being used in any country, of course.
All shipping modules can be used simultaneously.


You can contribute by sending your typical text with links to local delivery services, and I will include
them as different module for your country, ready-to-use for next users!
